# A* Pathfinding algorithm visualization
This is a simple A* implemtation. I've used [this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-search-algorithm/) for understanding the algorithm and it's implementation \  
and [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for visualizing the process.

## SDL2
I've also implemented the same visualization using only SDL.
```sh
$ make SDL
```
